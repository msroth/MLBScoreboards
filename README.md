# MLBScoreboards
VB .Net project to display live MLB scoreboards as well as other stats

Choose a date and see the all games played or scheduled for that date, including status, scores, and innings.  Select a game and 'watcb' the game live with scoreboard, commentary, and player stats.  Update intrvals for both game list and live game can be adjusted as desired.

This is a first attempt at this app, and though it works pretty well, there is certainly room for improvement.
